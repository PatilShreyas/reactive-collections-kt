# ‚ö° Reactive Collections for Kotlin

> _Mutable Collections that are also `StateFlow`s. Simple, powerful, and fun._

**Reactive Collections** is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that brings reactive programming to standard collections. 
Transform your regular `List`, `Set`, and `Map` into reactive data structures that emit updates through Kotlin Flows 
whenever their content changes.

## ü§î The Core Idea

In modern reactive programming, we often find ourselves needing to observe changes to a list or map. The common 
approach is to wrap it in a `MutableStateFlow`:

```kotlin
private val _users = MutableStateFlow<List<String>>(emptyList())
val users: StateFlow<List<String>> = _users.asStateFlow()

fun addUser(name: String) {
    val currentUsers = _users.value.toMutableList()
    currentUsers.add(name)
    _users.value = currentUsers.toList()
}
```

This is boilerplate-heavy and error-prone. **ReactiveCollections** solves this by merging the collection and the 
`StateFlow` into a single, elegant object:

```kotlin
val users = reactiveListOf<String>()

// Just... modify the list directly. That's it! ‚ú®
users.add("Alice")
```

Every mutation automatically and efficiently emits a new immutable snapshot to its collectors.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üì¶ Installation

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.shreyaspatil.reactivecollections:reactive-collections:1.0.0")
}
```

### Basic Usage

```kotlin
// Create reactive collections
val reactiveList = reactiveListOf("Apple", "Banana")
val reactiveMap = reactiveMapOf("key1" to "value1")
val reactiveSet = reactiveSetOf(1, 2, 3)

// Observe changes
reactiveList.asStateFlow().collect { list ->
    println("List updated: $list")
}

// Modify and see reactive updates - use any standard mutable collection operation
reactiveList.add("Cherry") // Triggers emission: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]
reactiveList.removeAt(0)   // Triggers emission: [Banana, Cherry]
```

## üìö Core API

### Creating Reactive Collections

```kotlin
// Lists
val emptyList = reactiveListOf<String>()
val listWithItems = reactiveListOf("A", "B", "C")
val fromCollection = listOf("X", "Y").toMutableReactiveList()

// Maps
val emptyMap = reactiveMapOf<String, Int>()
val mapWithItems = reactiveMapOf("key1" to 1, "key2" to 2)
val fromMap = mapOf("a" to 1).toMutableReactiveMap()

// Sets
val emptySet = reactiveSetOf<Int>()
val setWithItems = reactiveSetOf(1, 2, 3)
val fromSet = setOf("x", "y").toMutableReactiveSet()
```

### Observing Changes

All reactive collections expose a `StateFlow` that emits immutable snapshots:

```kotlin
val list = reactiveListOf<String>()

// Basic observation
list.asStateFlow().collect { snapshot ->
    println("Current list: $snapshot")
}

// With lifecycle awareness (Android/Compose)
list.asStateFlow().collectAsState()
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Batch Operations

If you need to perform multiple mutations at once, you can batch them to ensure the `StateFlow` only emits a single 
update after all operations are complete. This is crucial for performance-sensitive work, as it prevents multiple rapid 
computations.

Perform multiple operations with a single emission:

```kotlin
val list = reactiveListOf("A", "B", "C")

// Without batch - triggers 3 emissions
list.add("D")
list.add("E") 
list.removeAt(0)

// With batch - triggers only 1 emission
list.batchUpdate {
    add("D")
    add("E")
    removeAt(0)
}

// Async batch operations for suspending functions
list.batchUpdateAsync {
    // Suspending operations
    delay(100)
    add("F")
}
```

### üõ†Extension Functions

#### Lists: Observe Specific Indices

```kotlin
val list = reactiveListOf("A", "B", "C")

// Observe element at index 1
list.getAsFlow(1).collect { element ->
    println("Element at index 1: $element") // null if index doesn't exist
}

list[1] = "Modified" // Triggers emission: "Modified"
list.removeAt(1)     // Triggers emission: null
```

#### Lists: Observe Sublists

```kotlin
val list = reactiveListOf("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")

// Observe sublist [1, 4) - indices 1, 2, 3
list.subListAsFlow(1, 4).collect { sublist ->
    println("Sublist: $sublist")
}

// Strict mode (default): returns empty list if indices become invalid
list.subListAsFlow(1, 4, strict = true).collect { sublist -> /* ... */ }

// Lenient mode: coerces indices to valid range
list.subListAsFlow(1, 4, strict = false).collect { sublist -> /* ... */ }
```

#### Maps: Observe Specific Keys

```kotlin
val map = reactiveMapOf("user" to "John", "age" to "25")

// Observe value for specific key
map.valueAsFlow("user").collect { value ->
    println("User: $value") // null if key doesn't exist
}

map["user"] = "Jane"  // Triggers emission: "Jane"
map.remove("user")    // Triggers emission: null
```

## üîß Real-World Examples

### Android ViewModel with Reactive Collections

```kotlin
class TodoViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _todos = reactiveListOf<Todo>()
    val todos: StateFlow<List<Todo>> = _todos.asStateFlow()
    
    fun addTodo(todo: Todo) {
        _todos.add(todo)
    }
    
    fun updateTodos(updates: List<Todo>) {
        _todos.batchUpdate {
            clear()
            addAll(updates)
        }
    }
    
    fun toggleTodo(index: Int) {
        _todos[index] = _todos[index].copy(completed = !_todos[index].completed)
    }
}
```

### Real-time Data Synchronization

```kotlin
class DataRepository {
    private val _cache = reactiveMapOf<String, User>()
    val cache: StateFlow<Map<String, User>> = _cache.asStateFlow()
    
    suspend fun syncUsers() {
        val users = api.fetchUsers()
        _cache.batchUpdate {
            clear()
            users.forEach { user -> put(user.id, user) }
        }
    }
    
    fun observeUser(userId: String): Flow<User?> {
        return _cache.valueAsFlow(userId)
    }
}
```

and there can be many use cases...

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Why not just use `MutableStateFlow<List<T>>`?

While that works, it requires manual state management: you must get the current list, create a modified copy, and then 
set that new copy as the flow's value. This is verbose and introduces boilerplate. ReactiveCollections handles this 
process automatically under the hood, giving you a much cleaner and more direct API.

### 2. What is the performance overhead?

This depends on the size of data which is going to be used within collection. For each mutation, the library creates a 
new immutable snapshot (`toList()`, `toSet()`, `toMap()`, etc.) to emit. For most lightweight workloads, this is 
negligible. For high-frequency, bulk operations, you should use the `batchUpdate` function to ensure only one snapshot 
is created after all mutations are complete.

### 3. Is it thread-safe?

Reactive Collections **does not** provide built-in thread safety. This design choice gives you full control over
concurrency. The state emission is atomic. When you modify the collection, the update to the underlying `StateFlow` is 
a single, atomic operation. This means collectors will never receive a partially updated or corrupt state snapshot. 
However, the underlying mutable collection (`MutableList`, `MutableSet`, etc.) is not synchronized for concurrent writes. 
If you plan to call mutation functions like `add()` or `remove()` from multiple threads simultaneously, you must provide 
your own external synchronization (e.g., using a `Mutex`) to prevent race conditions.

For typical use cases, like mutations from a single UI thread or a dedicated background dispatcher, this is perfectly 
safe.

**Example:**

```kotlin
// Option 1: Synchronize access yourself
val list = reactiveListOf<String>()
val mutex = Mutex()

suspend fun safeAdd(item: String) {
    mutex.withLock {
        list.add(item)
    }
}

// Option 2: Use thread-safe underlying collections (Example for JVM)
val list = Collections.synchronizedList(mutableListOf<String>()).toMutableReactiveList()
```
